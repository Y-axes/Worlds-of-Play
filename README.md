# Worlds-of-Play
The aim is to teach young people to explore and keep moving forward, using the knowledge they have gained, given the fact that the more people know the more they are able do with their life.  Users are able to learn as much as they want with technology, when they not engaged tend to follow trends that can prove harmful, but through “Worlds of Play” they will automatically use the their education and practical ways and answer questions or get more out of the knowledge they possess because they will be living it at practice whenever they can.   In essence we are proposing that we take the entire process of learning and put it in a virtual environment based system and design it as edutainment.  Here the outcomes are practice based instead of theoretical or word based, and they will be able to gage the results according to what they aspire to be.  From general knowledge to specific subject knowledge about whatever the user wants to explore or chooses to engage in.
