# Scope
We simulate digital information for immersion purpouses, Users are able to learn as much as they want with technology, when they are able to follow trends that can prove useful, but through our systems they will automatically use their education and practical experience in ways and that will help them answer questions or get more out of the knowledge they possess from practice. We believe that we can take the entire process of simulating and put it in a single virtual environment.  Here the outcomes are practice based instead of theoretical, and they will be able to see the results according to what they spend their time doing.
